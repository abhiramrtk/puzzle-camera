# Puzzle Camera aka PaKa üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Usefulness


### Team Members

### Project Description
PaKa is a real-time camera-based sliding puzzle game that turns your live video feed into an interactive jigsaw puzzle. Players can choose from different difficulty levels and solve sliding puzzles using their own camera feed, creating a unique and personalized gaming experience that combines traditional puzzle mechanics with modern web technology.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever looked at yourself in a camera and thought "This is way too easy to understand - I can see my whole face at once!" We realized people desperately needed a way to make looking at themselves needlessly complicated and time-consuming. Why see your face normally when you can scramble it into tiny pieces and spend minutes putting it back together?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our revolutionary PaKa system takes your perfectly normal c### Project Documentation
For Software:amera feed and scientifically scrambles it into a sliding puzzle! Choose your preferred level of confusion (3x4, 4x4, or 5x5), and watch as your face gets chopped into pieces and shuffled around. Now you can waste precious minutes of your life clicking to reassemble yourself, because apparently looking at yourself normally was just too mainstream!
